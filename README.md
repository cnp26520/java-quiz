# Overview

To demonstrate my proficiency I java I created a quiz application that will run the user through a slew of multiple choice questions. Each Questions has a correlating answer and will notify you of such. It utilizes arrays arrays and variables to store the questions and answers, as well as the score for the participant. There is also interfacing to bring in a greeting method that the program uses as the quiz ends.

I wrote this to help me learn the fundamentals of working in Java. Quizzes are an excellent way for use to me able to test my knoweledge as well as that of others. Plus it's a neat tidy format that utilizes a
variety of tools in java.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I utilized Visual Studio Code as the IDE for this project.

I utilized java as well as importing scanner to be able to take responses from the participant.
